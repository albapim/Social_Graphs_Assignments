    "\n",
    "A problem with random networks as a model for real-world networks, according to section 3.5, is that in a large random network, the degree of most nodes is close to the average degree (‹k›), while in real-world networks, node degrees can vary much more widely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of a node in a network refers to the number of links it has to other nodes. In large random networks, node degrees follow a Poisson distribution, with a peak at ‹k›. This means that most nodes have degrees close to ‹k›, so the variability in node degrees is relatively small. In contrast, real-world networks often include nodes with very high degrees and others with very low degrees. For example, in a social network, some individuals may be highly connected, while others are more isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **List the four regimes that characterize random networks as a function of $\\langle k \\rangle$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Four different regimes can be distinguished in a random network as $\\langle k \\rangle$ changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tSubcritical regime: $0 < \\langle k \\rangle < 1$.\n",
    "If $\\langle k \\rangle = 0$, all nodes in the network are isolated. As $\\langle k \\rangle$ increases (but remains below 1), small clusters begin to form, but not all nodes are connected. Therefore, in this regime, we only observe small, disconnected clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tCritical regime: $\\langle k \\rangle = 1$.\n",
    "This is the critical point that separates the regime without a giant component from the one where a giant component emerges. At this point, clusters are still too small to be considered a true giant component.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tSupercritical regime: $\\langle k \\rangle > 1$.\n",
    "In this regime, a giant component exists. The further $\\langle k \\rangle$ increases above 1, the larger this giant component becomes. It coexists with other small, isolated components. This regime is the most relevant for modeling real systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tConnected regime: $\\langle k \\rangle > \\ln N$.\n",
    "In this regime, almost all nodes are connected, forming a single connected network. As $\\langle k \\rangle$ increases further, the network becomes denser, and it turns into a complete graph only when $\\langle k \\rangle = N - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the random network model shows that network formation is not gradual. For small ‹k› we see isolated nodes and small clusters, but at a critical point they suddenly start merging into a giant component.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **According to the book, why is it a problem for random networks (in terms of being a model for real-world networks) that the degree-dependent clustering $C(k)$ decreases as a function of $k$ in real-world networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a random network the local clustering coefficient is independent of the node’s degree and ‹C› depends on the system size as 1/N. In contrast, measurements indicate that for real networks C(k) decreases with the node degrees and is largely independent of the system size.\n",

    "> * Generate a lot of networks with different values of $p$. You will notice that paths are short when $p$ is close to one and they are long when $p = 0$. What's the value of $p$ for which the average shortest path length gets close to the short paths we find in a fully randomized network.\n",
    "> * Let's investigate this behavior in detail. Generate 50 networks with $N = 500$, $\\langle k \\rangle = 4$, for each of $p = \\{0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2\\}$. Calculate the average of $\\langle d \\rangle$ as well as the standard deviation over the 50 networks, to create a plot that shows how the path length decreases very quickly with only a little fraction of re-wiring. Use the standard deviation to add [errorbars](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar.html) to the plot. My version of the plot is below (since a picture's worth 1000 words).\n",
